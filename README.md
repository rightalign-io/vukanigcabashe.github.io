# spaceX:
> This is technical assessment from decidio, where i have to create functional react project using this space X [reference template](https://www.figma.com/file/KJfeYB8W7VTWCpEj9ar9gY/Spacex?node-id=0%3A1) for the UI and using the following liks for pulling data from the API.

### Tech Stack:
- **Reactjs**
- **Tailwindcss**
- **React-pagination**
- **Tanstack**
- **Axios**

## Rockets:

- This [rockets link](https://api.spacexdata.com/v4/rockets) allows us to connect to spaceX api and pull the rockets data for spaceX and display it.

## Ships:

- This [ships link](https://api.spacexdata.com/v4/ships) allows us to connect to spaceX api and pull the ships data for spaceX and display it.

## Company:
[Company](https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API/blob/master/docs/company/v4/all.md)
- This link allows us to connect to spaceX api and pull the company data for spaceX and display it.
## conditional Rendering:
- for react these are done with three methods but if prefer the [documentation example](https://reactjs.org/docs/conditional-rendering.html) as for me this looks cleaner and much simpler for my situation.

## Search functionality:

- Search is well known widget for react and I looked at the following reference on how we could implement it quicker and smoother [reference article](https://www.kindacode.com/article/how-to-create-a-filter-search-list-in-react/) as this helped me before with another system i trust that it will work.

## React Pagination:

- For thie project i chose to us the [react-pagination](https://openbase.com/js/react-paginate) tool which saved me time even though I had to get some domain knowledge first on using it correctly.

- Another reference is this [cronj article](https://www.cronj.com/blog/reactjs-pagination/) which explains further and much more clear about how to plug and play with this tool.
